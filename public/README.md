## Understanding the Data

### Clearing Prices Relationship
The UI clearly shows how clearing prices relate to trades:

1. **Token Indices**: Each trade uses `sellTokenIndex` and `buyTokenIndex` to reference tokens
2. **Price Matching**: Clearing prices at the same indices provide the exchange rates
3. **Visual Flow**: The trade flow shows the relationship between sell/buy tokens and their prices

### Example from Your Data
- **Sell Token**: USDC (Index 2) at price `0.000000000597418448`
- **Buy Token**: EURe (Index 3) at price `0.00000000069853`
- **Exchange Rate**: ~1.169 (calculated from the price ratio)

## Customization

### Adding New Token Information
Update the `tokenInfo` object in `script.js`:

```javascript
const tokenInfo = {
    "0xYourTokenAddress": {
        symbol: "SYMBOL",
        name: "Token Name",
        decimals: 18
    }
};
```

### Modifying the Data Source
Replace the `tradeData` object in `script.js` with your actual parsed data from the Ethereum service.

### Styling Changes
Modify `styles.css` to customize colors, fonts, and layout.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Express.js server for serving static files
- **Data Format**: Compatible with your parsed Ethereum transaction data

## Development
